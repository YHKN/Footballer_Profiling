# Footballer_Profiling

This project is part of my bachelor thesis for data science at Philipps-University of Marburg.

It generates player types based on stats from FBRef.com and assigns player type fitness and quality values to each player of europe's top 5 leagues.

Use **player_profiling.ipynb** to run the program. Player types are generated by running **setup_clusters()** and need to be named manually. My initial player types are saved in **centroids.csv** and the names in **player_type_names.json**, running **setup_clusters()** is therefore not necessary. Player type fitness and quality are generated by running **setup_current_season()** and saved into **scouting.csv**. To run any of the setup-functions an internet connection is necessary. **setup_clusters()** has a timeout after every season of stats collected to account for FBRef's web scraping policy. When running **setup_current_season()** set *market_values=False* if market values are not needed, as scraping of market values from transfermarkt.de takes several minutes.

Use function **list_player_types()** to get a list of player types to scout for and how to do so. Function **scout()** returns a list of the highest quality players that exceed a specified fitness value (default = 70). Minimum fitness value as well as age range, maximum market value and number of players shown can be set when running **scout()**.

All functions can be found in **footballer_profiling_functions.py**.
